### Understand the Basics
- Syntax: Learn the core syntax of pattern matching using case and in statements.
```ruby
case value
in pattern
  # do something
else
  # fallback
end
```

### Explore Supported Patterns
- Array Matching: Match arrays of specific sizes or with specific elements
```ruby
case [1, 2, 3]
in [1, 2, 3]
  puts "Matched!"
end
```

- Hash Matching: Match hashes with specific keys.
```ruby
case { name: "Ruby", version: "3.2" }
in { name: "Ruby", version: version }
  puts version # "3.2"
end
```

- Constant Matching: Match against constants.
```ruby
case "example"
in String
  puts "It's a string!"
end
```

- Variable Binding: Bind parts of a pattern to variables.
```ruby
case { a: 1, b: 2 }
in { a: x, b: y }
  puts x + y # 3
end
```

- Wildcard Matching (_): Ignore parts of the pattern.
```ruby
case [1, 2, 3]
in [_, 2, _]
  puts "Matched middle 2!"
end
```

### Advanced Matching
- Guards: Add conditions to patterns.
```ruby
case [1, 2]
in [a, b] if a < b
  puts "a is less than b"
end
```

- Nested Patterns: Match deeply nested data.
```ruby
case { data: { user: { id: 42, name: "Alice" } } }
in { data: { user: { id: 42, name: name } } }
  puts name # "Alice"
end
```
