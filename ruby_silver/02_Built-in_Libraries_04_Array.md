An Array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects, called elements. Any object may be an Array element.

### Array Indexes
Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java.

### Creating Arrays

An Array can contain different types of objects. For example, the array below contains an Integer, a String and a Float:
```ruby
a = [1, 'hello', 3.14]
``` 
An array can also be created by calling Array.new with zero, one (the initial size of the Array) or two arguments (the initial size and a default object).
```ruby
Array.new # => []
Array.new(3) # => [nil, nil, nil]
Array.new(3, 'abc') # => ['abc', 'abc', 'abc']

(1..3).to_a # => [1, 2, 3]
(1...3).to_a # => [1, 2]

hoge = *"a" # => ["a"]
```

### Adding Items to Arrays

#### unshift 
Will add a new item to the beginning of an array.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.unshift(0) # => [0, 1, 2, 3]

a = [1, 2, 3]
a.unshift # => [1, 2, 3]
```

#### insert
Will add a new item to an array at a specific index.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.insert(1, 'hello') # => [1, 'hello', 2, 3]
```

### Removing Items from an Array
#### pop
Will remove the last item from an array and return it.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.pop # => 3
a # => [1, 2]
```

#### shift
Will remove the first item from an array and return it.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.shift # => 1
a # => [2, 3]

a.shift(2) # => [1, 2]
a # => [3]
```

#### compact
Removes nil elements from an array; returns a new array.
```ruby
a = [1, nil, 2, nil, 3]
a.compact # => [1, 2, 3]
```

#### delete_if = reject!
Deletes every element of self for which block evaluates to true.
```ruby
scores = [ 97, 42, 75 ]
scores.delete_if {|score| score < 80 }   #=> [97]
```

#### delete
Deletes all items from self that are equal to item.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
a.delete(2) # => [1, 3, 4, 1]
```

### Iterating over Arrays
#### each
#### reverse_each
#### map

### Selecting Items from an Array
#### Non-destructive Selection
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
arr.select {|a| a > 3}       #=> [4, 5, 6]
arr.reject {|a| a < 3}       #=> [3, 4, 5, 6]
arr.drop_while {|a| a < 4}   #=> [4, 5, 6]
arr                          #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Range selection, fist argument is the index, second argument is length
arr[1,3] #=> [2, 3, 4]
```

- flatten
Returns a new array that is a one-dimensional flattening of self (recursively).
```ruby
a = [ 1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]], 6, [[[7, 8], 9]] ]
a.flatten # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

- flatten!
Flattens self in place.
```ruby
a = [ 1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]], 6, [[[7, 8], 9]] ]
a.flatten! # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

- each_cons
Iterates over the array in groups of length n, passing each group as a list to the block.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
a.each_cons(3) { |cons| p cons }
# => [1, 2, 3]
# => [2, 3, 4]
```

- product
Returns an array of all combinations of elements from all arrays.
```ruby
[1,2,3].product([4,5]) # => [[1,4],[1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,4],[3,5]]
```

- tranpose
Returns a new array by transposing self with other arrays.
```ruby
a = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
a.transpose # => [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]
```

- slice
Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a.slice(0, 3) # => [1, 2, 3]
```

- zip
Returns an array of arrays, which combines corresponding elements from self and the argument array.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
a.zip(b) # => [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
```

- scan
Returns an array of all items in self for which pattern === item.
```ruby
a = "hello world"
a.scan(/[aeiou]/) # => ["e", "o", "o"]
```

- fill
Fills the array with the given value.
```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.fill(0) # => [0, 0, 0]

# Fill with "A" starting from index 2
a.fill("A", 2) # => [1, 2, "A"]
```

- index
Returns the index of the first object in self such that the object is == to the argument.
```ruby
a = "ABCABCABC"
a.index("ABC", 4) => 6

# First argument is the substring, second argument is the index to start searching from
```

- sort
Sorts self in place using <=>.
```ruby
a = [3, 1, 2]
a.sort # => [1, 2, 3]

# Sort in descending order
# if a < b, return -1
# if a > b, return 1
# if a == b, return 0
# if -1 is returned, a is sorted before b
# if 1 is returned, b is sorted before a
# if 0 is returned, a and b are considered equal
a.sort {|a, b| b <=> a} # => [3, 2, 1]
```

- sort_by
Sorts self in place using a set of keys generated by mapping the values through the given block.
```ruby
a = [3, 1, 2]
a.sort_by {|a| a} # => [1, 2, 3]
# Sort by the result of the block
# Can sort by descending order by adding a negative sign
a.sort_by {|a| -a} # => [3, 2, 1]
```
