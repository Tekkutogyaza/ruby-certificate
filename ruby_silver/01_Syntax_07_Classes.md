### Class
When a new class is created, an object of type Class is initialized and assigned to a global constant

When Name.new is called to create a new object, the new method in Class is run by default

When does not explicitly specify a superclass, the Object class becomes the superclass

``` ruby
class Name
 # some code describing the class behavior
end
```
